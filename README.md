# Project Name to come



## Description

**Name to come** is presenting animals who are in need of a family to share happiness!

Verified organisations can register and manage their animals in our databases.

Users searching for an animal to love and respect as a member of their family can also register in order to save their favorite animals and be provided with the organisations' contact information.



## User flow

- **404** - a 404 page is displayed when a user tries to access a page that doesnâ€™t exist.

- **500** -  a 500 error page is displayed when I, as a developer, did something wrong.

- **homepage** - a homepage shows the goal of it all!

- **sign up** - a user can sign up as an already verified organisation or as a regular user.

- **login** - an organisation user can add their animals in need of a familiy to the database, change their status if they are adopted, and manage general organisation information. 

  A regular user can save their favorite animals and see how to adopt them.

- **logout** - any user can log out to keep their account safe.

- **animals in need** - anyone can see all the registered animals searching for a family.

- **animals adopted** - it's nice to see the new beautiful life of those who are already adopted, and everyone can do so!

- **Q and A** - a page to answer users' questions.



## Backlog

- **customized adoption forms**  - organisations could add their personalized forms in order to receive adoption proposals.
- **verified feedbacks** - any user could leave them after adoptions, for both organisations and people who adopted animals.
- **links to truthworthy animals professionals** - a page to help people find good professionals with positive education skills for example.
- **donation page** - to help us save more animals, everyone can help by giving something: time, financial support, physicial accessories, etc.
- **animals adopted** - improvment so that the verified people who adopted them can add photos of their new life.
- **organisations** - global information about those who have the animals in charge.
- more to come!
